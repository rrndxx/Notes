## 1. What is Tailwind CSS?

Before diving into the framework, understand **why** Tailwind CSS is so popular:

### 1.1 Utility-First CSS
- **Tailwind** is a **utility-first** framework, meaning it provides a set of low-level utility classes that can be composed to build complex designs without writing custom CSS.
- Example: `bg-blue-500`, `p-4`, `text-center`, `hover:bg-blue-700` are all classes you can apply directly to HTML elements.

### 1.2 Why Choose Tailwind CSS?
- **Highly customizable**: Tailwind allows easy customization using a configuration file.
- **Fast development**: Since you're using predefined utility classes, you can prototype and build interfaces quickly.
- **No need for naming classes**: With Tailwind, you donâ€™t need to write CSS class names like `.btn-primary`. You simply use classes like `px-4`, `bg-blue-500`, and `rounded`.
