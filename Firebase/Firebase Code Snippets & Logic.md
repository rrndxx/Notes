import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id",
  measurementId: "your-measurement-id"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
